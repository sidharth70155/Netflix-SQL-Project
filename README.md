## Schema

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);
```

## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```

**Objective:** Determine the distribution of content types on Netflix.

### 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

```sql
WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```

**Objective:** Identify the most frequently occurring rating for each type of content.

### 3. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE release_year = 2020;
```

**Objective:** Retrieve all movies released in a specific year.

### 4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM
(
    SELECT 
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) AS country,
        COUNT(*) AS total_content
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1
) AS t1
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Objective:** Identify the top 5 countries with the highest number of content items.

### 5. Identify the Longest Movie

```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT DESC;
```

**Objective:** Find the movie with the longest duration.

## Findings and Conclusion

- **Content Distribution:** The dataset contains a diverse range of movies and TV shows with varying ratings and genres.
- **Common Ratings:** Insights into the most common ratings provide an understanding of the content's target audience.
